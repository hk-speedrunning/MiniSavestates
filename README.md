# MiniSavestates

### How to use

The keybinds are customizable in `<saves location>/minisavestates.json` and by default it is
```json
{
    "LoadStateButton": "f1",
    "SaveStateButton": "f2"
}
```
When you save a state it gets saved to the file `<saves location>/minisavestates-saved.json`

# MultiSaveStates

The same as MiniSavestates, but with multiple slots (5 or 10, depending of the project).

### How to use

The keybinds are customizable in `<saves location>/minisavestates1.json` and by default have the same value as in MiniSavestates.

### Change slot

To change savestate slot, simply press any KeyCode.Alpha (between 0-9).
After changing slot, you can save/load the savestate normally using the keybinds (by default, the same as MiniSavestates).
